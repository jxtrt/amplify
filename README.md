# Amplify

Firefox extension to zoom an image with a \<dialog\>.

> 150 lines of javascript to implement a feature that should be shipped with firefox!

## Installation

While I get this published on the addon store, you can clone it and install it locally on your browser. Figure it out on your own.

## Usage

Right click an image. The context menu should show an "Amplify" option. If it does not, you have the modern web to thank for that.
